                        <span>The Writing Architect</span> was designed as an instructional tool to match research-based 
                        writing instruction with a students’ current level of development in critical areas of writing. 
                        This involves several steps. First, students will log into the Writing Architect Quick Write web application 
                        to plan and write a 15-minute essay and a 90-second typing fluency check. This web application also has a 
                        scoring and reporting system for the research team to score the students’ writing and for teachers to access 
                        the reports of the scores. There are different score types for two different purposes. The first purpose is 
                        determining instructional content needs. There are scores for 7 different facets of writing, which show where 
                        students have strengths and areas of instructional need. The 7 instructional scores are linked to research-based 
                        instructional materials located in this repository. The second score type is a general outcome measure, 
                        which is called correct minus incorrect writing sequences (CIWS). The purpose of the CIWS score is to monitor 
                        student progress from the beginning to the middle to the end of the year. CIWS does this well because it most 
                        highly related to student performance on the state’s ELA test and nationally-normed assessments of writing 
                        (Truckenmiller, McKindles, Petscher, Eckert, & Tock, 2020).
